# `x.FASTQ/test` folder

## `GSE22068` series
The `GSE22068_wgets.sh` file can be used as a suitable `TARGETS` argument to
test the __getFASTQ__ module, and provide some lightweight FASTQ files that can
be used as input to __trimFASTQ__ and __qcFASTQ__ for further testing.

In particular, the two links provided in the `GSE22068_wgets.sh` file point to a
couple of samples from the 2010 miRNA-Seq study *Expanding the MicroRNA
Targeting Code: A Novel Type of Site with Centered Pairing* by Shin C. *et al.*
([PMID: 20620952](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20620952/),
DOI: 10.1016/j.molcel.2010.06.005)

* __GEO IDs__: series `GSE22068` --> samples [`GSM548640`, `GSM548634`]
    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE22068

* __ENA IDs__: study `PRJNA128943` --> runs [`SRR058073`, `SRR058069`]
    https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA128943

The two FASTQ (.gz) example files were chosen for their small size, which allows
the developer to test __getFASTQ__ in a reasonable amount of time, while still
leaving a few minutes to try out the progress option (`-p`).

| ENA Accession | GEO Accession | Size    | Organism       |
| ------------- | ------------- |:-------:| -------------- |
| SRR058073     | GSM548640     | 36.1 MB | _Danio rerio_  |
| SRR058069     | GSM548634     | 86.1 MB | _Homo sapiens_ |

To test the `getfastq.sh` script, just copy and paste the `GSE22068_wgets.sh`
file where you want the FASTQ files to be downloaded (`<some_path>`) and run
```bash
getfastq "<some_path>"/GSE22068_wgets.sh
```
provided that __x.FASTQ__ modules have already been made globally visible.

## `GSE205739` series
The `GSE205739_Counts.zip` ZIP archive contains all the files and the
subdirectory structure, as generated by a standard __x.FASTQ__ pipeline applied
to the `GSE205739_wgets.sh` TARGETS (also included in the `test` folder for
reference).

To test `countFASTQ`, just copy and paste the `GSE205739_Counts.zip` ZIP archive
somewhere locally and run
```bash
unzip "<some_path>"/GSE205739_Counts.zip
countfastq -n [-i --metric=MTYPE] "<some_path>"
```
then, you can test the `PCA` option of `qcFASTQ` through
```bash
qcfastq --tool=PCA "<some_path>"
```
in both the cases, provided that __x.FASTQ__ modules have already been made 
globally visible.
