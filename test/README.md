# `x.FASTQ/test` folder

## `GSE22068` series
The `GSE22068_wgets.sh` file can be used as `TARGETS` argument for testing the
___getFASTQ___ module and downloading some lightweight FASTQ files from the
__ENA Database__, which can be used as input to ___trimFASTQ___ and
___qcFASTQ___ modules for further testing.

In particular, the two links provided in the `GSE22068_wgets.sh` file point to a
couple of samples from a 2010 miRNA-Seq study, titled *Expanding the MicroRNA
Targeting Code: A Novel Type of Site with Centered Pairing* by Shin C. *et al.*
([PMID: 20620952](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20620952/),
DOI: 10.1016/j.molcel.2010.06.005)

* __GEO IDs__: series `GSE22068` --> samples [`GSM548640`, `GSM548634`]
    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE22068

* __ENA IDs__: study `PRJNA128943` --> runs [`SRR058073`, `SRR058069`]
    https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA128943

The two FASTQ (.gz) example files were chosen for their small size, which allows
the developer to test ___getFASTQ___ features in a reasonable amount of time,
while still leaving a few minutes to try out the progress option (`-p`).

| ENA Accession | GEO Accession | Size    | Organism       |
| ------------- | ------------- |:-------:| -------------- |
| SRR058073     | GSM548640     | 36.1 MB | _Danio rerio_  |
| SRR058069     | GSM548634     | 86.1 MB | _Homo sapiens_ |

To test the `getfastq.sh` script, just copy and paste the `GSE22068_wgets.sh`
file where you want the FASTQ files to be downloaded (`<some_path>`) and run
```bash
getfastq "<some_path>"/GSE22068_wgets.sh
getfastq -m "<some_path>"/GSE22068_wgets.sh
getfastq -k
getfastq -p
```
provided that ___x.FASTQ___ modules have already been made globally visible (see
`x.fastq --links` option).

## `GSE205739` series
The `GSE205739_Counts.zip` archive contains all the files--and the subdirectory
structure--as generated by a standard ___x.FASTQ___ pipeline applied to the
`GSE205739_wgets.sh` TARGETS (also included in the `test` folder for reference).

To test the ___countFASTQ___ module, just copy and paste `GSE205739_Counts.zip`
somewhere locally (`<some_path>`) and run
```bash
unzip "<some_path>"/GSE205739_Counts.zip
countfastq "<some_path>"
countfastq -n "<some_path>"
countfastq -n -i "<some_path>"
countfastq -n -i --design="(...)" --metric=FPKM "<some_path>"
countfastq -p
```
then, you can also test the `PCA` option of the ___qcFASTQ___ module through
```bash
qcfastq --tool=PCA "<some_path>"
```
in both the cases, provided that ___x.FASTQ___ modules have already been made 
globally visible (see `x.fastq --links` option).
